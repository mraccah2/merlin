# WHY A MUTEX AT ALL
# `security list-keychains -d user -s <list>` is a whole-list REPLACE, not an
# append, so every caller must read-modify-write. That list is global state
# shared by every self-hosted runner on this host. Two concurrent signing jobs
# racing it lose each other's entry, and a list written from a stale read can
# drop login.keychain-db entirely — which takes Gandalf's Max auth down, because
# the OAuth token lives in the login keychain and there is no API-key fallback
# by design. See tools/system/architecture.md 2026-07-28.
#
# WHY CRASH-SAFE
# The original lock was a bare `mkdir` with no owner and no expiry. A job
# SIGKILLed between acquire and release (cancelled workflow, runner restart,
# machine sleep) held it forever; every later job then spun the full timeout and
# proceeded UNSYNCHRONIZED. The serialization silently disappeared exactly when
# builds were being cancelled most — i.e. precisely when it was needed. Two
# independent protections now cover the two distinct death modes:
#   1. trap-based release — a step that fails, errors, or exits early.
#   2. stale-lock breaking — SIGKILL / runner death, where no trap ever runs.
# Neither alone is sufficient: (1) cannot survive SIGKILL, and (2) alone would
# leave every ordinary failure holding the lock for the full stale window.

# Anything holding it for 5 minutes is dead, not slow.
